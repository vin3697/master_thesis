shutdown_costmaps: false        #Determines whether or not to shutdown the costmaps of the node when move_base is in an inactive state
controller_frequency: 10.0      #The rate in Hz at which to run the control loop and send velocity commands to the base.
planner_patience: 5.0           #How long the planner will wait in seconds in an attempt to find a valid plan before space-clearing operations are performed.
controller_patience: 15.0       #How long the controller will wait in seconds without receiving a valid control before space-clearing operations are performed.
conservative_reset_dist: 3.0    #The distance away from the robot in meters beyond which obstacles will be cleared from the costmap when attempting to clear space in the map. Note, this parameter is only used when the default recovery behaviors are used for move_base.
planner_frequency: 5.0          #The rate in Hz at which to run the global planning loop.
oscillation_timeout: 10.0       #How long in seconds to allow for oscillation before executing recovery behaviors. A value of 0.0 corresponds to an infinite timeout.
oscillation_distance: 0.2       #How far in meters the robot must move to be considered not to be oscillating.
